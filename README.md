Gears Of War The Board Game Console Companion App: 

Introduction:
A simple C# console app used in conjuction with Gears Of War The Board Game. This app was primarly used as a learning expirence to help me learn more about console based C# programs. 
I'm aware that console apps are probably not the best fit for board games, due to you being limited to only a PC, but I still thought it was a fun idea to see what I could come up with. 

Things to be aware:
- The "Scattered" mission will only appear in the menu if there are more than 1 players.
- The missions from Mission Pack 1 are in this app. You still will need to be aware of what each enemy Locust card is for each mission, however. 
- Most of the FAQs for the game are on this app including FAQ version 1.1 update
- Depending on interest, I might add some community based missions in the future, or perhaps try a mobile version of the game
